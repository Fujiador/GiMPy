GiMPy 1.3
=========

Graph Methods in Python (GiMPy) is a Python graph library containing pure
Python implementations of a variety of graph algorithms. The goal is clarity
in implementation rather than eficiency. Most methods have an accompanying
visualization and are thus appropriate for use in the classroom.

Documentation for the API is here:
